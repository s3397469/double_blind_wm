Similar to audio/speech watermarking, the main challenge in image watermarking
is trading off among capacity, invisibility (imperceptibility), and robustness
which is application-dependent.

Considering the quality aspects of the digitally watarmarked images, the main measurement aspects can be: 
imperceptibility of the watermark, robustness of the watermark embedding and verification process, degradation to the image and changes to the image size. The proposed watermark is tested for above attributeds The results displayed in this paper belongs to the Jelly beans (256x256) RGB image [X].




Once the watermark is embeded, the changes to the image should be unnoticable to both computers and human perception. To verify the impact on the changes made during the watermark embeddig porcess, PSNR  (Peak signal-to-noise ratio) test has been executed on 10 sample images.

ADD THIS TO WATERMARK SECTION : 

RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time.
